## Project Description

This is a web app made using Python and Flask Framework. 
It has a registration system and a dashboard. 
Users can enter keywords to retrieve live Twitter text based 
on the keyword, and analyze it for customer feelings and 
sentiments. This data can be visualized in a graph. 
This project, in particular, mines data using a popular 
“Tweepy” API. Tweepy API connects to Twitter in real-time and 
gathers metadata along with the text from the Twitter platform.  

## Purpose:<br>
To help companies study the customer sentiment around a particular product.<br>
To help system users analyze a huge amount of data, quickly and efficiently.<br>
To segregate customer sentiment on a scale of -1 to 1, where -1 represents a strong negative sentimentality towards the keyword(s), and 1 represents a strongly positive reaction.<br>
To visualize the collected data clearly and effectively.
